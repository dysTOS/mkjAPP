## Learning-Sandbox

This project was used to be my "learn-web-developement-sandbox" and still it is, but currently this app is also used in real-life by several bands.

## PWA Icons and IOS splash-screens

To automatically generate all needed PWA icons and splash-screens for iOS-devices, I used the free service [Progressier.com](https://progressier.com/pwa-icons-and-ios-splash-screen-generator).
